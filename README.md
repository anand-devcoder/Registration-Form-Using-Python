Project Description:<br><br>
The Registration Form Using Python with Image Capture is a desktop application designed to collect and store user details along with their photographs using a webcam. It provides a user-friendly interface for entering personal information such as Name, Email, Phone Number, Gender, Date of Birth, Department, and more. Additionally, the system integrates a real-time image capture feature using the computer's webcam, enabling the user to take a photo, which is then saved with their registration details.
<br>
This project is suitable for student registrations, employee onboarding, or event attendee tracking where both identity verification and data storage are required.
